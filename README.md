# Case-study-of-Water-Quality-of-USA
In this era of modernization, it becomes difficult to protect the environment from pollution. We need to take an approach that first finds the causing element and then treats it properly. Water is one of the essential elements of day-to-day life. In this Analytical research, we will try to find the top two elements, which are affecting the environment badly, and then we forecast the approximate prediction of those chemicals. We have used the United States Environmental Agency (EPA) real-time dataset and will forecast the water quality for the United States of America.


# Conclusion
As per the Analysis, the Radon is significantly higher than the required in the water even the forecast says it will increase in the water. Research says Radon can be inhaled from the air or ingested from water. Inhalation of radon increases the chances of lung cancer and this risk is much larger than the risk of stomach cancer from swallowing water with a high radon concentration[3].

When bismuth mix with water, it makes the water toxic. According to studies Bismuth + Water Bismuth reacts with vaporized water and forms trioxide bismuth(III) oxide (Bi2O3). It is important to note that for this reaction to take place, bismuth must be “red hot”, meaning that solid bismuth is so hot that it turns red. Cold, air-free water does not react with bismuth[1]. The permissible limit of Bismuth in water should be 0.3 µg/L but according to analysis, the forecasting quantity of bismuth in water will be significantly higher. The government should take some important actions[2].

Action needs to be taken: To protect the environment from these two chemicals we need to use the Aeration that reduce the mix of harmful chemicals. The best method for removing radon & bismuth from the water is an aeration system. An aeration system is typically installed next to the well tank where your water supply first enters the house. The aeration system is installed after other water conditioners such as a water softener or neutralizer [4].
