# Case-study-of-Water-Quality-of-USA
In this era of modernization, it becomes difficult to protect the environment from pollution. We need to take an approach that first finds the causing element and then treats it properly. Water is one of the essential elements of day-to-day life. In this Analytical research, we will try to find the top two elements, which are affecting the environment badly, and then we forecast the approximate prediction of those chemicals. We have used the United States Environmental Agency (EPA) real-time dataset and will forecast the water quality for the United States of America.
